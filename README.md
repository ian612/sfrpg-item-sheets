# README
This Foundry VTT module for the Starfinder (SFRPG) system adds alternate item sheets with improved "Details" tabs.
Every item type in the game system has a new sheet, with improved layour and organization.

### Example
An example of two types of item sheets are shown below. They include clearer groupings for settings, and subtabs to break sections down further.
